  ## Description
  A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

  A polished GitHub profile is an important part of your public identity as a developer. Why? For one thing, it will most likely be the first place that potential employers look to evaluate your skills and professionalism. And it also allows you to connect with and showcase your work to other developers, which can lead to interesting collaborations.

  ## Installation 

  It is important to have the following programs installed on your computer: 
  * `VS Code` 
  * `Node.js`

  ## Usage 
  
  Steps to generate your own README: 
  * `Git clone` the repo.
  * Run `npm install` in order to install the npm package dependencies as specified in the `package.json`.
  * Invoke the application using `node index.js` command
  * Answer the prompted questions in the command line to create a markdown file for a README.
